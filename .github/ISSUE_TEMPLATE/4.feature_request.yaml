        Find the App Id in the last portion of your URL. For example:

        https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=<AWS-REGION>#/<APP-ID>

        OR

        Within the Amplify Console, navigate to App Settings -> General -> App Arn, and inspect the last portion of the identifier:

        arn:aws:amplify:AWS-REGION:accountId:apps/<APP-ID>
        ```
        Note: Type `NEW_APP` if you are experiencing issues while creating a new Amplify application
